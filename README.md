# Drawing Mannipulation

Welcome to the Drawing Manipulation project! In this project, we explore the possibility of generating drawings based on the "Quick, Draw!" game developed by Google and available at https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com.

To train the model, you can run the script train.py by entering python train.py in your terminal. You can also get more information on the available arguments by running python train.py --help.

This project is based on the Labml.AI implementation of Sketch-RNN: https://github.com/labmlai/annotated_deep_learning_paper_implementations/blob/master/labml_nn/sketch_rnn/__init__.py.

The .sh files in this repository are used to communicate with the CATIE server.

You can find some drafts of our work in the notebooks folder.
